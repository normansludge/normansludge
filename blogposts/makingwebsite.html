            <h1><strong>Making the Website</strong></h1>
            <h2>A brief look at some semblance of process</h2>
            <p>After years of wanting to make a website, I finally decided to fully commit to not just going through the motions of HTML and CSS, but actually designing (with a plan) and hosting a website. In fact, here I am writing this blog post for that very website right now! Sludge Emporium is my newest project and I think it would be sort of fun to go through how I went about making it.</p>
            <p>Sludge Emporium&rsquo;s code is an absolute disaster. Unfortunately, because of the way the internet functions, I can&rsquo;t hide the source code from anyone. My shame lays bare for anyone who bothers to use their browser&rsquo;s inspect tool. If you&rsquo;re viewing on mobile, then you likely already see the problem without even needing to read a single line of CSS. Regardless, I am proud if it. I &ldquo;made&rdquo; a lot of the art for the site and I did something I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever done as an &ldquo;artist&rdquo; before: I made a plan and executed it fairly accurately.<sup><a href="#sdfootnote1sym" name="sdfootnote1anc">[1]</a></sup> I drew a bunch of thumbnail sketches on index cards&mdash;which are the best note taking tools in the world and the subject of an essay for another day&mdash;and then chose my favorite and tried to recreate it.</p>
            <img src= "assets/websitesketch.jpg" class="embimg">
            <p>I think I kinda nailed it. There are some details which, as of writing, I&rsquo;d like to implement later on: an animated vignette of fog, floating dust particles, a music player that functions (I can&rsquo;t seem to get it to work outside of the live server). But for now, I am very proud of my work. Especially since my previous attempts to make a visually interesting website were mostly unplanned.</p>
            <img class = "embimg" src ="assets/attempt2.JPG">
            <p style="text-align: center;"><i>this was the first successful attempt</i></p>
            <img class = "embimg" src ="assets/attempt3.JPG">
            <p style="text-align:center;"><i>this was a more serious second attempt</i></p>
            <p>You can see how I sort of iterated on the same ideas&mdash;most centrally my rat avatar Norman being a focal piece of the whole thing. The skeleton of the site (which I brutalized within minutes) was provided by [I CAN&rsquo;T FIND THIS SITE].The rat avatar is really old at this point, but the process I used to make it and all the variants is what I did to make all the art of my site. Basically everything is a digital collage of PNGs that I then pixelate using this lovely website: <a href="https://pixelartvillage.com/">https://pixelartvillage.com/</a>. I did this for all the art except three bits: the slime waterfall and title, the background wall, and the pipe. The slime waterfall and title I made using good ol&rsquo; classic pixel art. The title was easy enough&mdash;just slimy bubble letters&mdash;but the slime waterfall was a little trickier. I don&rsquo;t know how it looks the way it does, but miraculously it does convey the idea of a liquid falling. I made a brief three frame animation. All I did was put the highlight colors on a separate layer and drag them down each frame, adding a bit of noise and filling in the gaps in the process. I figured it wasn&rsquo;t going to work, but was pleasantly surprised when it actually did.</p>
            <p>The pipe was comically difficult to make. I wanted a very specific shape and I wanted only the pipe, so my usual visual style of layering PNGs (covering up undesirable shapes with other images) wasn&rsquo;t going to work. Instead, I went to GIMP and I took a stock image of a pipe and hacked it into the shape I wanted. I had never used GIMP before, so it took forever and I&rsquo;m still not fully proud of it. I made the pipe thicker, added a bend, fixed the shadows (kinda but not really.. just don&rsquo;t look to close), and pixelated the whole thing to cover up the dubious details. In the end, it works.</p>
            <p>The last bit of art was kindly provided to me by my older brother. The background honestly carries the visuals of the whole site. I&rsquo;m uncertain if it would even be legible as this sort of gross, dingy sewer system without it. Plus, it gets all the colors I wanted in a single image which I never would be able to achieve with the same smoothness using my PNG collage method.</p>
            <p>That is pretty much it! Just a beautiful mess. As of writing, I&rsquo;ve yet to make the Portfolio or Misc pages since I&rsquo;m still unsure of what to put on there. I make &ldquo;art&rdquo; I can post&mdash;stuff like origami and models. I also have math papers I could upload and presentations and more generally things I&rsquo;m up to. I&rsquo;ll sort it out later, I suppose.</p>

            <p><a href="#sdfootnote1anc" name="sdfootnote1sym">[^1]</a>The excessive use of scare quotes is primarily to avoid criticism from the actually talented artists in my life. I am a judge penitent&mdash;I already know my &ldquo;art&rdquo; is questionable, but who are you to think yours is more legitimate?</p>
