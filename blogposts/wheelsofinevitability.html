        <h1><strong>The Wheels of Inevitability </strong></h1>
<h2>The improbable existence of things + 7 links to things I found interesting.</h2>
<p><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33c12ddc-2391-40c2-8aa3-02bae13f0c24_3579x2684.png" alt="" name="Image1" border="1" class="embimg"/></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been reckoning with inevitability lately. I think everyone has. The grand republican experiment &mdash; government of the people, by the people, for the people &mdash; feels more than ever like just an experiment. It&rsquo;s odd to see the institutions that were constant for my entire life get shaken so thoroughly. Normally in times like this, I look at the broader trends of our history and comfort myself: <em>when</em> we bounce back this moment will just be remembered as just a temporary dip in a graph.</p>
<p><em>When </em>has been fully overtaken by this uncertain feeling of <em>if</em>.</p>
<p>I still hold in my heart that <em>when </em>will prevail &mdash; though maybe not in my lifetime. But when the United States and the entire world continue to follow those mostly upward trends of minimizing human suffering, it won&rsquo;t be because it is inevitable.</p>
<p>Alright, I&rsquo;ll stop there. I promised myself I wouldn&rsquo;t write about politics that much.<sup><a href="#footnote1" target="_self" id="return1">[1]</a></sup> Instead, I&rsquo;ll offer up a variety of comforts, mostly about/in-spite-of the fallacy that is inevitability.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>&ldquo;<em>Human progress never rolls in on wheels of inevitability; it comes through the tireless efforts of men willing to be co workers with God, and without this hard work, time itself becomes an ally of the forces of social stagnation.&rdquo;</em></blockquote>
<blockquote>&mdash; <em>Martin Luther King Jr., &ldquo;Letter from Birmingham Jail&rdquo;</em></blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Now is as good a time as ever to be reading works from the civil rights movements. It is Black History Month and MLK day was just less than a month ago &mdash; not that it was anyone&rsquo;s primary attention at the time.<sup><a href="#footnote2" id="return2" target="_self">[2]</a></sup>It&rsquo;s worthwhile to read and think about. I have a big list of all my favorite reads out of the dozen or so pieces I&rsquo;ve finished so far. If you click on only one of the links below, let it be Malcolm X.</p>
<p>I chose the quote from a letter MLK directly wrote to several clergymen. They chastised him and the movement for its timing and methods. It is a moment of absolute moral certainty that is easily one of my favorite pieces of rhetoric. It is genuinely shocking to me that it isn&rsquo;t taught in American history classes everywhere. It is obviously worth reading within the historical context of the 1960s and the United States, but I have been thinking about the letter as a reflection on how to make progress toward anything.</p>
<p>I remember taking long road trips to the beaches in San Diego when I was a kid. I&rsquo;d press my nose against the glass to watch the terrain float by. It was a sort of miracle that we were driving to San Diego. Despite climbing up and out of the valley Phoenix finds itself in, despite passing through the utterly inhospitable Imperial Sand Dunes, despite the hundreds of miles separating us from civilization: there was a well-paved road.</p>
<p>It felt inevitable that roads would be everywhere when I was a kid, but of course that isn&rsquo;t true. There was a time before cars and a time before the Lincoln Highway and a time before the Interstate. People had to build these things. The Lincoln Highway was a back-of-the-napkin calculation by an automobile enthusiast. The Interstate Highway System was finished in 1992 and took billions of dollars and thousands of hours of hard work to complete.</p>
<p>It is hard to imagine what it was like before these roads, but even harder to imagine the work that came into bringing them to existence. Once things have been created, it is impossible to imagine that they couldn&rsquo;t have and that one day they may cease to be. The tireless efforts of God&rsquo;s coworkers are too easily forgotten, yet their accomplishments are often too fragile to disregard as being inevitable.</p>
<p>So there is sort of a theme for the links I want to share today. The majority of the links will be about the hard work that I take for granted. There are people who work hard on things that make the world better. It is a lot easier for things to not exist than for them to exist. I am writing in appreciation of everything they have done. It is important to appreciate the existence of anything in the face of such improbable odds.</p>
<p>As an exercise for the reader, I highly recommend thinking about what things you imagine as being inevitable or ubiquitous and considering how they came to be. It is generally a good exercise to feel both empowered in your own ability to create and hopeful at humanity&rsquo;s capacity to do good things &mdash; both of these feelings may be in short supply, so I hope this helps.</p>
<p>Alright.</p>
<p>Without further ado: here is my list of cool things I want to share.</p>
<hr />
<p>Some things I found interesting:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I am no scholar in Black history and this list is far from exhaustive on things that are worth reading on the subject. These are just my three favorite<sup><a href="#footnote3" id="return3" target="_self">[3]</a></sup> primary sources I&rsquo;ve read while reading about the civil rights movements.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="https://letterfromjail.com/" target="_blank">Martin Luther King Jr.'s "Letter from Birmingham Jail"</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.historyisaweapon.com/defcon1/baldwindungeonshook.html" target="_blank">James Baldwin's "My Dungeon Shook"</a></p>

<li>
<p><a href="https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/speeches-african-american-history/1964-malcolm-x-ballot-or-bullet/" target="_blank">Malcolm X's "The Ballot or the Bullet"</a></p>
</li>

<p>I mentioned the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Highway" target="_blank">Lincoln Highway</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_Highway_System" target="_blank">Interstate Highway System</a>. Everything you need to know<sup><a href="#footnote4" id="return4" target="_self">[4]</a></sup> is in the first couple lines of these Wikipedia pages. If you have an exorbitant amount of free time, then I&rsquo;d recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmFQR0IltDQ" target="_blank">this travelogue</a> by Noah Caldwell-Gervais. It&rsquo;s remarkable how much of the American spirit can be experienced through the history of a long road.</p>

<p>On the long list of things of immeasurable value yet are threatened by the possibility of their nonexistence: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/scishow/videos" target="_blank">SciShow</a>. Turns out making well-researched, facts-based science content for free isn&rsquo;t sustainable without listener support. I was going to link to <a href="https://complexly.store/collections/scishow-postcard?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=product_shelf" target="_blank">some postcards</a> that would support them directly, but thankfully they have sold out (you can still support their <a href="https://www.patreon.com/scishow" target="_blank">Patreon</a>). My heart grows a little larger every time I see people who still come together to make good things happen.</p>

<p>Superbowl Sunday is coming up and I recently just finished Jon Bois&rsquo; <em><a href="https://www.sbnation.com/a/17776-football" target="_blank">17776</a></em>in preparation. It&rsquo;s worth reading purely because of its unique use of the media it&rsquo;s crafted in, but also the story itself is strangely profound and comforting. The end of Chapter 16 is about &ldquo;forgotten lawns&rdquo; and how infinite doesn&rsquo;t mean inevitable. <em>17776 </em>will stick with me for a long time.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The James Webb Space Telescope has a special place in my heart &mdash; especially when I think about how things aren&rsquo;t inevitable and it takes hard work to have anything exist.<sup><a href="#footnote5" id="return5">[5]</a></sup><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu97IiO_yDI" target="_blank">Destin Sandlin&rsquo;s video </a>on the sun-shield made me cry when I first saw it. But today, I&rsquo;m showing love to Hubble and the recent release of a <a href="https://esahubble.org/images/heic1502a/?utm_source=badastronomy.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=a-n-d-r-o-m-e-d-a-redux" target="_blank">4.3 GB photo of the Andromeda Galaxy</a>. It can&rsquo;t be shown in full resolution, but luckily the nice folks at NASA made an <a href="https://esahubble.org/images/heic1502a/zoomable/" target="_blank">online tool</a> so you can zoom around in another galaxy for a bit.</p>

<p>When I first started writing the essay portion, I was trying my best to remember <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nld8m-O_gs" target="_blank">this video</a> from vlogbrothers. After searching around, I finally found this cute title and promptly stole it for my sub-header. It kind of captures the feeling I had about roads growing up. Also, the <a href="https://www.projectforawesome.com/" target="_blank">Project For Awesome</a> is in a week! In case it isn&rsquo;t obvious, I frequently return to Nerdfighteria when I feel myselfing losing faith. There are good people there. I&rsquo;d recommend you do the same.</p>

<p>Alright, how about only one poem? <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46473/if---" target="_blank">If&mdash; by Rudyard Kipling</a>. I don&rsquo;t particularly care for the last line, but the lines<br /><br /><em>&ldquo;If you can dream&mdash;and not make dreams your master; <br /> If you can think&mdash;and not make thoughts your aim;&rdquo;</em><br /><br /> and the lines<br /><em><br /> &ldquo;If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br /> With sixty seconds&rsquo; worth of distance run,&rdquo;</em><br /><br /> were quite nice.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>Alright, that is all I got for this week. Thanks for reading and maybe clicking on a link or two.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to keep making these, so if you have something you think is worth sharing, please let me know! Everything I find has been made or shared by other people, so you&rsquo;d be aiding the process of interesting things getting the attention they deserve.</p>
<p>Message Norman</p>
<p>Leave a comment</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try to keep it maybe a bit lighter in theme next week. Or maybe I won&rsquo;t, there are no guarantees on the future anymore.</p>
<p>I hope you have a good week nonetheless.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="#return1" target="_self" id="footnote1">[^1]</a> Some (me) would argue that the personal IS political. I should still work to avoid the pundit pipeline, though.</p>
<p><a href="#return2" target="_self">[^2]</a> I promise this will be my last allusion to anything explicitly political in the 21st century.</p>
<p><a href="#return3" target="_self">[^3]</a> Alright, you got me, I have more than three favorites. Here are two more bonus essays worth reading: &ldquo;<a href="https://www.historyisaweapon.com/defcon1/davispoprprblli.html" target="_blank">Political Prisoners, Prisons, and Black Liberation</a>&rdquo; by Angela Y. Davis and &ldquo;<a href="https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/combahee-river-collective-statement-1977/" target="_blank">The Combahee River Collective Statement</a>.&rdquo; Davis&rsquo; work feels like it could have been written a week ago.</p>
<p><a href="#return4" target="_self">[^4]</a> I&rsquo;ve got beef with &ldquo;everything you <em>need </em>to know&rdquo; as a statement. It&rsquo;ll get what&rsquo;s coming for it eventually.</p>
<p><a href="#return5" target="_self">[^5]</a> Bonus recommendation: <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-disordered-cosmos-a-journey-into-dark-matter-spacetime-and-dreams-deferred-chanda-prescod-weinstein/14887308" target="_blank">The Disordered Cosmos</a></em> by Dr. Chanda Prescod-Weinstein. It&rsquo;s a book about particle physics, dark matter, and the pain and the beauty of science done by real human beings working for fallible institutions.</p>
