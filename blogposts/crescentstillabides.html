<p>The Project For Awesome has finally begun today! For context: the P4A is a 48-hour-long charity livestream hosted by Hank and John Green. They have been doing this every year for almost two decades and have donated over $10 million to charities of the community&rsquo;s choosing.</p>
<p>This charity event is a very big deal to me. I am a staunch believer in the beauty of collective action and the empathy of my fellow humans &mdash; but I&rsquo;d be lying if I said the start of this year has been very affirming. This charity livestream always seems to come around right when that belief begins to wane.</p>
<p>Today &mdash; as is every day &mdash; is a good day to be a part of this community. Links to everything P4A below. If you&rsquo;re able, feel free to participate.</p>
<p>Anyways.</p>
<p>Speaking of waning: the moon.<sup><a href="#ft1" id="return1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<hr />
<p>&ldquo;<em>Each that we lose takes part of us; <br /> A crescent still abides, <br /> Which like the moon, some turbid night, <br /> Is summoned by the tides.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>by Emily Dickinson</em></p>
<hr />
<p><em>This post is really more of a personal update than anything else, so feel free to skip it.</em></p>
<p>I have now been without a smartphone for about a couple weeks and I already feel as though the loss has taken a massive part in the way I now choose to spend my time.</p>
<p>For one, I now write a small essay each Friday night, which is fun. But a much bigger change in my life has been the sheer amount of reading I do. I have read four books in the last week and a half. I have read dozens of essays, blog posts, news articles, etc. I mean, I am reading and quoting poetry <em>by choice</em>. Something has clearly changed.</p>
<p>Reading is great &mdash; I would recommend doing it (hence the links) &mdash; but I don&rsquo;t feel as though my lack of a smartphone has made me any less misanthropic when it comes to actually creating things and directly experiencing my own life.</p>
<p>How many times do I have to compile a giant list of cool things other people have put out into the world before I realize that I could be doing the same? Consuming &ldquo;the arts&rdquo; is great, but there is more to consciousness than reveling in the creations of others and more than writing stories and essays in my own bedroom. Turns out, there is a world outside.</p>
<p>So, in the coming weeks, I will leave the La-Z-Boy and do some more stuff outside the house. I&rsquo;m getting breakfast burritos every Monday with a friend, building a trebuchet<sup><a href="#ft2" id="return2">[2]</a></sup>, starting a <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons </em>campaign, folding origami, volunteering at a math exhibition event, driving to a live show in LA, and doing whatever else happens to pop up.</p>
<p>Join me. Step outside yourself into the world. Sign up for a local event, give to charity, play a silly game, or get breakfast with some old friends; find a reason to be a part of something &mdash; anything &mdash; with other people. There is so much stuff to do and so many great people to meet if you put in the effort to find it. In getting breakfast burritos, me and my friend met this lovely old man named Ron and we always chat about cars and coffee. It&rsquo;s banal small talk, yet it has done more to make me feel more like a human being than all the books and poems I&rsquo;ve read in the last week.</p>
<p>I really think this is what I&rsquo;m trying to do with this big collection of links each week. This is an effort to reflect and share my experiences with others. Surfing the Internet is lovely, but <em>sharing</em> what I&rsquo;ve found and <em>creating</em> an &ldquo;essay&rdquo; (however brief or contemporaneous) inspired by those finds is really the crown of my Maslow pyramid lately.</p>
<p>Anyways.</p>
<p>Without further ado: a list of things worth sharing.</p>
<hr />
<p>Some things I found interesting this week:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I can&rsquo;t shill<sup><a href="#ft3" id="return3">[3]</a></sup> this enough: <a href="https://www.projectforawesome.com/">The Project for Awesome</a> is live! You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/vlogbrothers/live">watch the livestream</a> (if you are reading before Sunday night), <a href="https://tiltify.com/+p4a-producers/project-for-awesome-2025">donate</a>, or simply vote on a charity you&rsquo;d like some of the money to go to! This means a lot to me since it feels like I am an active participant in something bigger than me &mdash; and you can always <a href="https://www.projectforawesome.com/community">join in</a>, even if you don&rsquo;t have money to spare.</p>

<p>I already directly quoted my second favorite Emily Dickinson poem about <a href="https://www.poetrynook.com/poem/each-we-lose-takes-part-us">the moon and loss</a>, but here is my all-time favorite: <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/42889/hope-is-the-thing-with-feathers-314">&ldquo;Hope&rdquo; is the thing with feathers.</a></p>

<p>It turns out that &mdash; however metaphorically resonant &mdash; the tides are summoned by the moon, not the other way around. Johannes Kepler is a bit of an OG when it comes to describing tides, gravity, orbits, and our solar system, but he also had a truly tragic life. I recently read Maria Papova&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2019/12/26/katharina-kepler-witchcraft-dream/">article about Kepler</a> in <em><a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/">The Marginalian</a></em> and it is arguably an even better discussion of his work and life than the one in <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/cosmos-carl-sagan/6779746"><em>Cosmos </em>by Carl Sagan</a>. I do owe it to Sagan, though. He introduced me to one of my favorite theories of all time: <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysterium_Cosmographicum">Mysterium Cosmigraphicum</a></em>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">

<p>Turns out Kepler isn&rsquo;t the only person to measure space, though. Grant Sanderson of<a href="https://www.3blue1brown.com/"> 3Blue1Brown</a> (one of the greatest math communicators alive) recently teamed up with Terence Tao (one of the greatest mathematicians alive) to explain <a href="https://youtu.be/YdOXS_9_P4U">how we measured the cosmos</a>. The math is simple, which makes it so clever and ingenious. The video is worth the watch.</p>

<p>I mentioned I am driving to LA for an event, and I&rsquo;m not gonna gate-keep. The <a href="https://pst.art/en/events/pst-art-open-house">PST ART Open House</a> is on March 1st! It&rsquo;s an all-day exploration of my two favorite things: art and science. I am most excited to hear from Latif Nasser from <em><a href="https://radiolab.org/">Radiolab</a></em>and astrophysicist/novelist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janna_Levin">Janna Levin</a><em>. </em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been reading a lot of manifestos<sup><a href="#ft4" id="return4">[4]</a></sup>, and I&rsquo;ve got to say that among my favorites have to be Stallman&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.en.html">GNU Manifesto</a>&rdquo; about computer operating systems and the <a href="https://georgemaciunas.com/">Fluxus</a> manifestos about the future of art (both <a href="https://georgemaciunas.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/maciunas-menifesto1.jpg">one </a>and <a href="http://georgemaciunas.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/Flux-manifesto.jpg">two</a>) by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Maciunas">George Maciunas</a>. They are not talking about the same thing at all&hellip; but they are. Fluxus is especially awesome. Don&rsquo;t be shocked if I write more about the movement in the future.</p>

<p>Someone made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ronVv0AqkR8">vocaloid in Desmos</a> and it has completely blown my mind. I have been meaning to learn more about synthesizers, and this may be the final nail in the coffin. The fact that we can synthesize the human voice is cool, and so is the fact this dude can play <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UevtAOlmyZc">breakcore drums live</a>.</p>

</ol>
<hr />
<p>That&rsquo;s all folks. I think this may be the last time I do a weekly roundup of a bunch of links. I love writing, but this 500-word essay followed by a bunch of links feels pretty restricting on my creativity. The &ldquo;7 links to things I found interesting&rdquo; series will not die as a trilogy, but it may no longer be the only thing I write every week.</p>
<p>In the future, expect actual reviews, analyses, and explainers instead of just a brief &ldquo;it is good check it out&rdquo; that the list restricts me to. The nice thing about having no actual audience is that I can do this without feeling like I&rsquo;m betraying anyone. If you do hate this idea, let me know.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading. This was a bit of a lazier post, but I hope you found at least one thing you enjoyed.</p>
<p>Have a good weekend!</p>

<p><a href="#return1" id ="ft1">[^1]</a>Literary scholars will study this transition for centuries.</p>
<p><a href="#return2" id ="ft2">[^2]</a>I can, but will not elaborate.</p>
<p><a href="#return3" id="ft3">[^3]</a>Is it really shilling if it is for a charity?</p>
<p><a href="#return4" id="ft4">[^4]</a>Don&rsquo;t put me on a list. It is for research and educational purposes.</p>
