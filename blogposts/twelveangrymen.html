            <h1><strong>12 Angry Men Review (kinda)</strong></h1>
            <h2>Angry thoughts written in haste</h2>
            <p>So the United States government just deported a legal permanent resident for protesting Israel&rsquo;s wanton disregard for civilian casualties in Palestine. I feel like I&rsquo;m going insane whenever I read online discourse about it. I understand that being a reactionary is easier than actually reading anything, but it still shocks me how a significant portion of the population doesn&rsquo;t see this as a massive leap towards fascism. Anyone who claims Mahmoud Khalil is a terrorist can&rsquo;t identify a single crime he committed and anyone who says he&rsquo;s at least a sympathizer can&rsquo;t point to any connections he has to Hamas because they haven&rsquo;t looked, they just took the administration&rsquo;s claims at face value. Even if he did call for death to America &ndash; which he didn&rsquo;t do &ndash; that would be legal, permissible speech. That is what the 1<sup>st</sup> Amendment is for. If you have any doubts about Khalil or his protests, please fucking read literally anything he has directly said. Remember the sixty thousand dead Palestinians and the millions more being displaced so Trump can turn Gaza into a strip mall and read that against the words of Khalil.</p>
            <p>To state the obvious, I&rsquo;ve been a little worried lately. Normally when I&rsquo;m stressed about modern issues, I dive headfirst into the literature. Free speech has been a big ugly question for the majority of American history and I&rsquo;ve been especially enjoying <em>Excitable Speech</em> by Judith Butler. But I reached a tipping point of anxiety and needed a break. To relax, I decided to watch a courtroom drama.</p>
            <p><em>12 Angry Men </em>came out in 1957 and follows the story of 12 jurors arguing on the potential conviction of a young Italian kid who allegedly killed his father. In the beginning, all but one of the jurors move to sentence the kid to death, and one-by-one, over the length of the movie, each juror changes his vote to not guilty. It&rsquo;s clear at the outset what the verdict was going to be, but each subsequent plot point and converted vote was satisfying to watch. It&rsquo;s a masterclass of how courtroom dramas can capture the feelings of cleverness and discovery of a detective story and elevate them in the confines of a single room. There are no missing pieces to the puzzle. The case for not guilty has to be made by the re-contextualization of every piece of evidence in service of the narrative for guilty. Unlike detective stories, there is nothing else to be discovered; all the cards are already on the table.Courtroom dramas live or die by the character&rsquo;s ability to construct plausible stories atop the foundational evidence and poke logical holes in alternatives. In a genius subversion of the genre, <em>12 Angry Men </em>takes the task of building narratives out of the hands of lawyers and gives it to a group of ordinary people. The messy, tense, ever-evolving chemistry among the group of fallible men is what makes the movie an all-time great.</p>
            <p>While I do think <em>12 Angry Men </em>is timeless, there are certain things that place it well in the past, the most obvious of which are all stylistic choices or hardware limitations &ndash; the grainy black-and-white film and long shots with few jump cuts. What really firmly sets the film in the 20<sup>th</sup> century is the racism towards Italian people. It seems a little silly to suggest that Italian people aren&rsquo;t considered white now, but it is clear that was the case in the 1950s. Several jurors made arguments about how the kid was capable of violence and incapable of being rehabilitated into civil society on the basis of his race. The arguments are shunned at the end, but only the Italian juror outwardly protested those suggestions at the beginning. The characters all believed they had an easy, collective verdict to make because of their ubiquitous whiteness on the jury, butas the movie progresses that unity breaks down due to differences in age, class, and character.</p>
            <p>White culture as a monolith doesn&rsquo;t exist. The only throughline for what is considered &ldquo;white&rdquo; is an individual&rsquo;s proximity to power. Right now, in the real world, it is clear we have a fracturing definition of whiteness with regard to cultural perceptions of Jewish people. Antisemitism is undeniably on the rise. Zionists hide behind the ethnic and religious Jewish identity to debase legitimate arguments against the apartheid Israeli regime as antisemitism and it is working. An ever-increasing portion of the young population is conflating the institutional power used by Zionists to commit genocide as being a power held by all Jews.&nbsp;By conflating these identities as being the same &ndash; which they are not &ndash;&nbsp;Zionists are&nbsp;breeding antisemitism.&nbsp;As&nbsp;Israel&nbsp;continues to receive billions of dollars in funding as major cuts are made to&nbsp;imperiled&nbsp;nations like Ukraine, life-saving health services like USAID, and other essential facets of the administrative state, these sentiments will become more prevalent.</p>
            <p>The current assumed identity of Jewish people as being white is tenuous and impermanent. This is what brings me so much pain in regard to the discourse surrounding Mahmoud Khalil. Setting a precedent of political deportations of &ldquo;non-citizens&rdquo; while also expanding the definition of non-citizens to green card holders and eventually to birthright citizens is going to be disastrous for everyone &ndash; especially Jewish people. Not all Jewish people are Zionists and allowing the deportation of Khalil is setting the stage for deporting anti-Zionist Jews and eventually just Jewish people themselves. By focusing on an easily marginalized group of people, the administration is creating a political mechanism that will allow more deportations in the future. For all those cheering at the sidelines, there will be a time when you are staring down the barrel of the weapon you helped create.</p>
            <p>This is how fascism starts.</p>
            <p>I give <em>12 Angry Men </em>five stars.</p>
