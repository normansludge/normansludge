<p style="text-align:center; font-size:14px;"><em>You already know what painting this is.</em></p>
<p>Howdy!</p>
<p>The links are at the bottom, but I wrote some very brief thoughts on how to reconcile wanting to be a writer but hating to share the things I&rsquo;ve written.</p>
<p>Feel free to skip to the bottom</p>
<hr />
<p>I&rsquo;ve been keeping a journal for over two years now. I don&rsquo;t hold myself to any strict schedules on when I should write or what I should write about, so the notebook only has the thoughts I felt were too overwhelming to keep stored up in my head. I had finally read through some of the first entries a few months ago and was pretty disappointed. I couldn&rsquo;t go more than a few pages without finding a new list of goals, actionable plans and timelines to achieve those goals. Inevitably there was an entry a few pages later that reads like a sober apology to my past self: <em>I haven&rsquo;t stuck to my timelines. I was too focused on the dumb unproductive things.</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve grown a lot since the days of &ldquo;productivity or perish.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t really view relaxing as a moral failure anymore<sup><a href="#ft1" id="return1"target="_self">[1]</a></sup>, yet I find myself once again filling up journal entries with grandiose plans and timelines. I made a big list of literally everything I was interested in:</p>
<blockquote><em>I want to write math explainers for magazines and get a job as a tutor and create a newsletter where I write about my objectively correct opinions on contemporary discourse in politics and culture and I want to get yolked and have a specific friend group just to make art with and I want to play the saxophone and&hellip;</em><sup><a href="#ft2" id="return2"target="_self">[2]</a></sup></blockquote>
<p>I cut back a bit on the scope and made step-by-step plans for writing specifically since I think I may want a career or something in it. That was a month ago (New Years, y&rsquo;know). I haven&rsquo;t really made good on those plans, like at all.</p>
<p>I have an odd mental block when it comes to sharing things I make. If I&rsquo;m writing for myself and I know that all the words I mush together into sentences will remain in some folder on my computer, I have no problem putting thousands, creating a couple hundred kilobytes worth of words. Yet, every time I start to write something I plan on sharing &mdash; something that will escape the obscurity of my (C:) drive &mdash; I lose faith in my skills and let it waste away in a sub-folder for things I will share &ldquo;one day.&rdquo;</p>
<hr />
<blockquote><em>My painting is dead.</em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>Defend it for me, Giovanni, protect my honor.</em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>I am not in the right place&mdash;I am not a painter.</em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>&mdash; </em><em>Michelangelo (1509)</em></blockquote>
<hr />
<p>I heard about this quote while listening to a podcast in the shower and I read about it further over breakfast. This is how Michelangelo ended a letter he wrote to a friend while he was slaving away painting the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel &mdash; a rare work of art so technically impressive and visually stunning that it has been placed well within both the artistic cannon and the common knowledge of non-artists.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t want to draw any false equivalences here&hellip; but I should probably get over myself and just start publishing things. Even one of the greatest artists in history felt like an impostor while creating his magnum opus. I really can&rsquo;t afford to be stressing over making something perfect. I&rsquo;m writing about things I think are cool for an audience of no one, not getting commissioned by the Pope to paint the house of God.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure why specifically this quote inspired me so much, but dissecting my inspiration is a surefire way to kill it. Instead, I&rsquo;ll use it as an excuse to finally write something simple and low-stakes on the internet.</p>
<p>I can already feel myself trying to back out of writing this. A reminder for myself: the intended audience is not the paying patrons of some magazine or journal. This is for friends and family. This is not a lengthy opinion piece on what happened to Claudine Gay and the destruction of educational institutions nor a rambling, misguided review of <em>Infinite Jest</em>. Those pieces will remain locked up in the (C:) drive indefinitely.</p>
<p>This is a handful of links to things that I found interesting over the last week or so. Hopefully, I&rsquo;ll find the courage to write more interesting things for those bigger audiences some day. For now, I&rsquo;ll get over myself and finally start painting my incomparably shittier version of the Sistine Chapel.</p>
<p>Without further ado: here is my list of cool things I want to share.</p>
<hr />
<p>Some things I found interesting:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I really think the rest of the <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/57328/michaelangelo-to-giovanni-da-pistoia-when-the-author-was-painting-the-vault-of-the-sistine-chapel" target="_blank">sonnet/letter</a> that Michelangelo wrote is worth reading. Also, since it wasn&rsquo;t written in English there are <a href="https://wikipoem.org/2014/11/20/to-giovanni-da-pistoia-when-the-author-was-painting-the-vault-of-the-sistine-chapel-1509/" target="_blank">other translations</a> from the <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/363909" target="_blank">original text</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I first ran into Michelangelo&rsquo;s letter when I was listening to the newest episode of what is quickly becoming my favorite podcast: <a href="https://www.letslearneverything.com/" target="_blank">Let&rsquo;s Learn Everything!</a> They have all the cute quirks of earnest people who are genuinely passionate about the world they found themselves in. I couldn&rsquo;t recommend them more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The elevator in my building sucks. It sucks so bad that I had enough time to think about optimal elevator algorithms while I waited. Turns out, the optimal elevator is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568494624003417#sec6" target="_blank">still being written about</a> &mdash; this paper was published in June of last year. Also, the abstract version of the problem has a lot more application than elevators &mdash; its most obvious influence being the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_algorithm" target="_blank">SCAN</a> disk-scheduling algorithm. I plan on writing more about this once I get the chance to read it thoroughly.</p>

<p>Your favorite mathematician&rsquo;s<sup><a href="#ft3" id="return3" target="_self">[3]</a></sup> favorite digital audio workstation: <a href="https://www.desmos.com/" target="_blank">Desmos</a>! Not to be a <a href="https://www.geogebra.org/" target="_blank">GeoGebra</a> hater, but Desmos hosts a <a href="https://www.desmos.com/art" target="_blank">yearly art competition</a> (2023 winners <a href="https://www.desmos.com/art-2023" target="_blank">here</a>) and just over a year ago they added a <a href="https://help.desmos.com/hc/en-us/articles/21373904717197-Tone" target="_blank">tone function</a> that essentially allows the calculator to function as a synthesizer. Here are some of my favorite compositions so far:<sup><a href="#ft4" id="return4" target="_self">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>I recently read Gabrielle Zevin&rsquo;s novel <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/tomorrow-and-tomorrow-and-tomorrow-gabrielle-zevin/17502475" target="_blank">Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow </a></em>and it was seriously really good. I wrote a more in-depth review &mdash; more than &ldquo;it was really good&rdquo; &mdash; but that is locked in deep under (C:). I&rsquo;d say read the book, but a whole 400 page novel is a big ask for a list of links. The book is named after <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/56964/speech-tomorrow-and-tomorrow-and-tomorrow" target="_blank">this soliloquy</a> from an indie play you&rsquo;ve probably never heard of, <em>Macbeth.</em> It is a much shorter read. I find it somehow both depressing and comforting. I, for one, am enjoying my time fretting upon the stage.</p>

<p>Now, I said I wasn&rsquo;t going to write about politics&hellip; BUT this is old enough to not have any direct relevance to modern-day politics. I don&rsquo;t mean to out myself as a David Foster Wallace fan since it has a bit of <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2015/08/david-foster-wallace-beloved-author-of-bros.html" target="_blank">a negative connotation</a> in literary circles, but I found this piece on <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/david-foster-wallace-on-john-mccain-the-weasel-twelve-monkeys-and-the-shrub-194272/" target="_blank">John McCain&rsquo;s campaign</a> to be something special. It is a glimpse into the grim reality of campaign trails and asks impossible questions about true character and proximity to power. It is a little long, but maybe toss it in the bookmarks for later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not to sure why this is such a poetry-heavy list &mdash; I really didn&rsquo;t think I was that into poetry &mdash; but my favorite rap collective <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFNjjg_9XURYU2IcbfxXv0w" target="_blank">Coast Contra</a> is back in the studio and they uploaded what is best described as the only <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnEYboac-9g" target="_blank">slam poetry</a> I have ever enjoyed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>I think these are all the links I am going to include. I have some more stuff I think might be worth sharing but I&rsquo;ll just toss that in a bookmarks folder and save it for if there is ever a &ldquo;next time&rdquo; I do this.</p>
<p>If anything, it was worthwhile to try and think about all the things I saw recently that I think would be fun to share. It&rsquo;s kinda like an internet gratitude journal. More likely than not, I will make another list.</p>
<p>I hope you found at least one thing worth your time.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="#return1" id="ft1">[^1]</a> how about those high school academic decathlon medals tho</p>
<p><a href="#return2" id="ft2">[^2]</a> The whole list is exhausting to read. There are too many cool things.</p>
<p><a href="#return3" id ="ft3"target="_self">[^3]</a> This is meant to be me, but I&rsquo;m not really a mathematician (yet) nor even a math communicator (yet). Bonus link to who should be your favorite math communicator: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Gardner" target="_blank">Martin Gardner</a>.</p>
<p><a href="#return4" id = "ft4"target="_self">[^4]</a> I think everyone picked up on the best naming format to appease the algorithm gods.</p>
