    BEWARE ALL YE WHO ENTER. TURN BACK NOW. THIS CODE IS SO HORRENDOUS
    THAT THE IDEA OF SOMEONE LOOKING AT IT MAKES ME GENUINELY ILL. 
    PLEASE JUST ACCEPT THAT THIS SITE LOOKING THE WAY IT DOES IS A MIRACLE.
    IF IT DOESN'T LOOK THE WAY ITS SUPPOSED TO, I'M SORRY.

                            <p>THIS IS MY PERSONAL WEBSITE. I ORIGINALLY PLANNED ON MAKING IT SEMI-PROFESSIONAL, BUT I SPENT TOO MUCH TIME ON NEOCITIES AND DECIDED TO BUILD SOMETHING MORE FUN. I WILL TAKE A GAMBIT AND HOPE THAT A FUN, SOMEWHAT-UGLY WEBSITE IS MORE INTERESTING THAN A MORE TRADITIONAL WIX-TYPE SITE.</p>
                            <p>I AM AN UNDERGRADUATE STUDYING MATH AND ENGLISH AND I WANT TO USE THIS SITE TO AGGREGATE ALL THE THINGS I'M UP TO. IF THE WEBSITE IS MOSTLY EMPTY, THEN YOU ARE EARLY! I MOSTLY MADE THIS AS AN EXCUSE TO MAKE SOMETHING FUN AND I'LL HOPEFULLY FIND SOME GOOD USE FOR IT LATER.</p>
                            <p>THE BLOG LINK WORKS FOR SURE, AT LEAST.</p>
